# IceCrawl Project TODO List

## High-Impact, Feasible Improvements (from Competitor Analysis)

1. **Optional AI/NLP Extraction**

   - Integrate Llama or similar open-source LLMs as a toggleable feature.
   - Use for smart content parsing, entity extraction, summarization, etc.
   - Make it opt-in to avoid errors or unwanted dependencies.

2. **Change Tracking**

   - Add a feature to periodically crawl and compare snapshots of target pages.
   - Alert/log when significant changes are detected.
   - Useful for monitoring competitors, price changes, news, etc.

3. **Document Scraping**

   - Integrate libraries like pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or docx2txt for extracting from PDFs/DOCX.
   - Make document extraction modular/optional.

4. **Community/Marketplace Foundation**

   - Start with a simple template/plugin sharing system (even just a GitHub repo or web UI section).
   - Encourage user contributions and sharing.

5. **Enhanced Dashboard**

   - Visualize crawl results, change logs, and extraction statistics.
   - Show LLM extraction results side-by-side with raw data.

6. **Proxy/Anti-bot (Optional)**
   - Provide documentation or hooks for users to add their own proxy solutions if needed.
